  * It should not break your Group Managed Service Accounts (gMSAs), but if the gMSA password expires and it needs to request a new password, it will not be able to generate a new password until a new KDS Root Key is installed and ready for use. Because of this, the last KDS Root Key will not be removed unless this option is specified
* **`[String]` DistinguishedName** _(Read)_: Specifies the Distinguished Name (DN) of the KDS root key.
  * The KDS Root Key is stored in 'CN=Master Root Keys,CN=Group Key Distribution Service,CN=Services,CN=Configuration' at the Forest level. This is also why replication needs 10 hours to occur before using the KDS Root Key as a safey measure.

### Create an Active Directory Replication Site

In this example, we will create an Active Directory replication site called
'Seattle'.

```powershell
configuration Example_xADReplicationSite
{
    Import-DscResource -Module xActiveDirectory

    Node $AllNodes.NodeName
    {
        xADReplicationSite 'SeattleSite'
        {
           Ensure = 'Present'
           Name   = 'Seattle'
        }
    }
}

Example_xADReplicationSite

Start-DscConfiguration -Path .\Example_xADReplicationSite -Wait -Verbose
```

### Create an Active Directory Replication Site (Rename Default-First-Site-Name)

In this example, we will create an Active Directory replication site called
'Seattle'. If the 'Default-First-Site-Name' site exists, it will rename this
site instead of create a new one.

```powershell
configuration Example_xADReplicationSite
{
    Import-DscResource -Module xActiveDirectory

    Node $AllNodes.NodeName
    {
        xADReplicationSite 'SeattleSite'
        {
           Ensure                     = 'Present'
           Name                       = 'Seattle'
           RenameDefaultFirstSiteName = $true
        }
    }
}

Example_xADReplicationSite

Start-DscConfiguration -Path .\Example_xADReplicationSite -Wait -Verbose
```

### Remove an Active Directory Replication Site

In this example, we will remove the Active Directory replication site called
'Cupertino'.

```powershell
configuration Example_xADReplicationSite
{
    Import-DscResource -Module xActiveDirectory

    Node $AllNodes.NodeName
    {
        xADReplicationSite 'CupertinoSite'
        {
           Ensure = 'Absent'
           Name   = 'Cupertino'
        }
    }
}

Example_xADReplicationSite

Start-DscConfiguration -Path .\Example_xADReplicationSite -Wait -Verbose
```

### Create an Active Directory OU

In this example, we add an Active Directory organizational unit to the 'example.com' domain root.

```powershell
configuration Example_xADOrganizationalUnit
{
Param(
    [parameter(Mandatory = $true)]
    [System.String]
    $Name,

    [parameter(Mandatory = $true)]
    [System.String]
    $Path,

    [System.Boolean]
    $ProtectedFromAccidentalDeletion = $true,

    [ValidateNotNull()]
    [System.String]
    $Description = ''
)

    Import-DscResource -Module xActiveDirectory

    Node $AllNodes.NodeName
    {
        xADOrganizationalUnit ExampleOU
        {
           Name = $Name
           Path = $Path

Start-DscConfiguration -Path .\Example_xADOrganizationalUnit -Wait -Verbose

```

### Configure Active Directory Domain Default Password Policy

In this example, we configure an Active Directory domain's default password policy to set the minimum password length and complexity.

```powershell
configuration Example_xADDomainDefaultPasswordPolicy
{
    Param
    (
        [parameter(Mandatory = $true)]
        [System.String]
        $DomainName,

        [parameter(Mandatory = $true)]
        [System.Boolean]
        $ComplexityEnabled,

        [parameter(Mandatory = $true)]
        [System.Int32]
        $MinPasswordLength,
    )

    Import-DscResource -Module xActiveDirectory

    Node $AllNodes.NodeName
    {
        xADDomainDefaultPasswordPolicy 'DefaultPasswordPolicy'
        {
           DomainName = $DomainName
           ComplexityEnabled = $ComplexityEnabled
           MinPasswordLength = $MinPasswordLength
        }
    }
}

Example_xADDomainDefaultPasswordPolicy -DomainName 'contoso.com' -ComplexityEnabled $true -MinPasswordLength 8

Start-DscConfiguration -Path .\Example_xADDomainDefaultPasswordPolicy -Wait -Verbose
```

### Create an Active Directory Computer Account

In this example, we create a 'NANO-001' computer account in the 'Server' OU of the 'example.com' Active Directory domain.

```powershell
configuration Example_xADComputerAccount
{
    Param
    (
        [parameter(Mandatory = $true)]
        [System.String]
        $DomainController,

    {
        xADComputer "$ComputerName"
        {
           DomainController = $DomainController

### Create an Active Directory Computer Account and an ODJ Request File

In this example, we create a 'NANO-200' computer account in the 'Nano' OU of the 'example.com' Active Directory domain as well as creating an Offline Domain Join Request file.

```powershell
configuration Example_xADComputerAccountODJ
{
    Param
    (
        [parameter(Mandatory = $true)]
        [System.String]
        $DomainController,

        [parameter(Mandatory = $true)]
        [System.Management.Automation.PSCredential]
        $DomainCredential,

        [parameter(Mandatory = $true)]
        [System.String]
        $ComputerName,

        [parameter(Mandatory = $true)]
        [System.String]
        $Path,

        [parameter(Mandatory = $true)]
        [System.String]
        $RequestFile
    )

    Import-DscResource -Module xActiveDirectory

    Node $AllNodes.NodeName
    {
        xADComputer "$ComputerName"
        {
           DomainController = $DomainController
           DomainAdministratorCredential = $DomainCredential
           ComputerName = $ComputerName
           Path = $Path
           RequestFile = $RequestFile
        }
    }
}

Example_xADComputerAccountODJ -DomainController 'DC01' `
    -DomainCredential (Get-Credential -Message "Domain Credentials") `
    -ComputerName 'NANO-200' `
    -Path 'ou=Nano,dc=example,dc=com' `
    -RequestFile 'd:\ODJFiles\NANO-200.txt' `
    -ConfigurationData $ConfigurationData

Start-DscConfiguration -Path .\Example_xADComputerAccount -Wait -Verbose
```

### Create User Principal Name (UPN) suffixes and Service Principal Name suffixes

In this example the User Principal name suffixes "fabrikam.com" and "industry.com" and Service Principal name suffixes "corporate.com" are added to the Contoso forest.

```powershell
configuration Example_ADPrincipalSuffix
{
    Param
    (
        [parameter(Mandatory = $true)]
        [System.String]
        $TargetName,

        [parameter(Mandatory = $true)]
        [System.String]
        $ForestName,

        [parameter(Mandatory = $true)]
        [String[]]
        $UserPrincipalNameSuffix,

        [parameter(Mandatory = $true)]
        [String[]]
        $ServicePrincipalNameSuffix
    )

Import-DscResource -ModuleName xActiveDirectory

    node $TargetName
    {
        xADForestProperties $ForestName
        {
            ForestName = $ForestName
            UserPrincipalNameSuffix = $UserPrincipalNameSuffix
            ServicePrincipalNameSuffix = $ServicePrincipalNameSuffix
        }
    }
}

$parameters = @{
    TargetName = 'dc.contoso.com'
    ForestName = 'contoso.com'
    UserPrincipalNameSuffix = 'fabrikam.com','industry.com'
    ServicePrincipalNameSuffix = 'corporate.com'
    OutputPath = c:\output
}

Example_ADPrincipalSuffix @parameters

Start-DscConfiguration -Path c:\output -Wait -Verbose
```
