# Change log for xActiveDirectory

## Unreleased

## 2.26.0.0

- Changes to xActiveDirectory
  - Added localization module -DscResource.LocalizationHelper* containing
    the helper functions `Get-LocalizedData`, `New-InvalidArgumentException`,
    `New-InvalidOperationException`, `New-ObjectNotFoundException`, and
    `New-InvalidResultException` ([issue #257](https://github.com/PowerShell/xActiveDirectory/issues/257)).
    For more information around these helper functions and localization
    in resources, see [Localization section in the Style Guideline](https://github.com/PowerShell/DscResources/blob/master/StyleGuidelines.md#localization).
  - Added common module *DscResource.Common* containing the helper function
    `Test-DscParameterState`. The goal is that all resource common functions
    are moved to this module (functions that are or can be used by more
    than one resource) ([issue #257](https://github.com/PowerShell/xActiveDirectory/issues/257)).
  - Added xADManagedServiceAccount resource to manage Managed Service
    Accounts (MSAs). [Andrew Wickham (@awickham10)](https://github.com/awickham10)

  - Added xADKDSKey resource to create KDS Root Keys for gMSAs. [@kungfu71186](https://github.com/kungfu71186)

    ([issue #75](https://github.com/PowerShell/xActiveDirectory/issues/75)). [Eric Foskett @Merto410](https://github.com/Merto410)
  - Fixed a bug with the parameter `InstallationMediaPath` that it would
    not be added if it was specified in a configuration. Now the parameter
    `InstallationMediaPath` is correctly passed to `Install-ADDSDomainController`.
  - Refactored the resource with major code cleanup and localization.
  - Updated unit tests to latest unit test template and refactored the
    tests for the function 'Set-TargetResource'.
  - Improved test code coverage.
- Changes to xADComputer
  - Restoring a computer account from the recycle bin no longer fails if
    there is more than one object with the same name in the recycle bin.
    Now it uses the object that was changed last using the property
    `whenChanged` ([issue #271](https://github.com/PowerShell/xActiveDirectory/issues/271)).
- Changes to xADGroup
  - Restoring a group from the recycle bin no longer fails if there is
    more than one object with the same name in the recycle bin. Now it
    uses the object that was changed last using the property `whenChanged`
    ([issue #271](https://github.com/PowerShell/xActiveDirectory/issues/271)).
- Changes to xADOrganizationalUnit
  - Restoring an organizational unit from the recycle bin no longer fails
    if there is more than one object with the same name in the recycle bin.
    Now it uses the object that was changed last using the property `whenChanged`
    ([issue #271](https://github.com/PowerShell/xActiveDirectory/issues/271)).
- Changes to xADUser
  - Restoring a user from the recycle bin no longer fails if there is
    more than one object with the same name in the recycle bin. Now it
    uses the object that was changed last using the property `whenChanged`
